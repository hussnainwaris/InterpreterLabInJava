Abstract:
An interpreter that reads a file with a declarative language containing variable declarations and simple arithmetic operations. These commands are then executed and the result is displayed.
Objectives:
•	Create an Interpreter which can execute simple arithmetic commands and store variable declarations.

•	Read the declarations from a file.

•	Use a Version Control System (VCS) to manage their solutions

Language: Java
IDE: Eclipse
Tasks:
•	Look for syntax errors in the declaration file.
•	Implement the interpreter to execute the declarations.

Files form and how interpretation would be done:

Declarations of variables 
Arithmetic operation on two immediate values and storing in variable
Arithmetic operation on two variables and storing in variable
Arithmetic operations one variable and one immediate value and storing in variable
Printing immediate value
Printing variable 

ERRORS
Not Initialized
Initialization error as ‘a’ is not initialized using Var declarative
Syntax Errors
Immediate value can’t be used to store value
 missing
Invalid Arithmetic Operation
